# System Overview

The main part of the ELISSA system is the air bearing table. It provides a planar surface and air cushion for the freeflyer to move with reduced friction. The system is developed to recreate an on-orbit environment with low residual acceleration, low illumination and a motion capture system as a GPS equivalent. The system consists of four subsystems:

* Aeromechanical subsystem
* Motion tracking subsystem
* Freeflyer subsystem
* Mission control subsystem

These systems are essential for operations on the air bearing table. In addition to the laboratory the ELISSA framework provides a simulation environment. In this section, the following elements of the system are described:

## Lab Environment

The laboratory environment of the ELISSA system consists of the described four subsystems:

* Aeromechanical subsystem
* Motion tracking subsystem
* Freeflyer subsystem
* Mission control subsystem

The laboratory room with the air bearing table is shown in the image below. The table has a length (x-direction) of 7 m and a width (y-direction) of 4 m. As can be seen, the table is made out of different panels. These panels have either a dimension of 2,33 m x 0,8 m or 1,75 m x 0,8 m, depending on the row. The table is split in two half at x = 3,5 m. Each half is supplied by a different air blower, so the operator can decide to use only one or both table parts.
